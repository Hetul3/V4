                  Electricity represents the movement of charged particles called electrons. When we think of circuits, 
                  we should imagine electrons moving through the wires. Don't imagine atoms with electrons through the wire, there 
                  aren't any or few protons and neutrons also moving, it's just electrons.<br/><br/>
                  The way that a circuit moves electrons is through using the idea of charges, since like charges repel and different 
                  charges attracts. So you need a closed circuit for electrons to move. In a battery or a power-source that emits electrons will 
                  start off with the negative charge on the end that electrons are moving out, and the other end will be positive so that electrons move there. <br/><br/><br/>

                  The basic unit of electricity is <b>charge</b> represented by the letter Q and it represents the quantity of electrons. The units for charge is <b>Coulombs</b> represented by the letter C. 
                  In general charge is hard to measure since 1 C = 6.24x10^18 electrons.<br/><br/>
                  <b>Voltage</b> is represented by the letter V and it represents how much energy each charge has. The units for voltage are volts and are represented by the same 
                  symbol. Voltage can also be solved with the equation <b>V=E/Q</b> where V = volts, E = joules of energy, Q = charge in coulombs. In general, when you 
                  contact two bare wires, the higher the voltage the more sparks will be generated.<br/><br/>
                  <b>Current</b> is how many electrons move past one point in a wire in 1 second, represented by the symbol I. The units for current is Amperes represented by the 
                  symbol A. Current can also be found by the equation <b>I = Q/t</b> where I = current, Q = charge, t = time in seconds. High current in wires results in 
                  results in lots of electricity flowing, meaning lots of friction and heat being generated.
                  <br/><br/>
                  An analogy to imagine current flowing through wires is like water volume, while voltage is like water pressure. When having a parallel split in the wire, assuming you have 100A, will split 
                  into 50/50, while 100V will be both 100V on both sides. Resistence is added up in series from resistors, and is inversally added when they split into parallel.

              <p>
                  The basic circuit has three parts, the source which provides electricity and energy to electrons, a load which will take in electrons and use up the energy that the electrons carry from the sourse, 
                  and wires that cannect the source and the load. If you don't have a source, the load won't function, if you don't have a load, the wire will short circuit and burn out since there isn't a load to use up 
                  the source's energy and it builds up in the wire. <br/><br/>
                  You can have more than one source, more than one load, and more wires that can be in series (don't split) or parallel (split in two or more).<br/><br/><br/>
                  These are the other symbols for circuit diagrams.<br/><br/>

                  <p>

                  The important ones to remember are:<br/>Resistors create resistence which lowers voltage for the purpose of the voltage being too much for a load to handle. It basically uses the electrical power without any providing any work or purpose<br/><br/>
                  Switches open and close the circuit, this way, you can disturb the connection and turn the electricity flow on and off. <br/><br/>
                  Ground is there to direct excess electricity away, grounding electricity inserts it to an insulated material, usually the ground to direct the electricity away.<br/><br/>
                  LED represents a type of light bulb (light emitting diod).<br/><br/>

              <h1 id="AC vs DC">AC vs DC</h1>
              <p>
                  DC stands for direct current, this is when the electricity that is flowing from the source has a constant voltage, usually about 50V. Most devices use DC as 
                  a constant voltage means that the energy held by the electrons is constant and almost all electrical devices take in DC current to function. <br/><br/>
                  AC stands for alternating current, this is when electricity that is flowing is alternating its voltage. In North America it alternates 120V at 60Hz and in the rest of the world 
                  it alternates 220V at 50Hz. The outlet usually emits electricity in AC current and electrical devices convert it to DC. AC exists because when generating and producing electricity it is done 
                  in AC.<br/></p>

                  <p>

                  The current wars were between Edison vs Tesla where Edison wanted all current to be DC, while Tesla wanted them all to be AC.

              <p>
                  When given electrical diagrams, you'll either be asked to construct circuit diagrams given constraints or objectives. In this case, you need to know the different between series and parallel.
                  </p>
                  <center><img src="images/66.png" class="img"></center>
                  <p>


                  You'll also be asked to figure out voltage, current, or resistent in different points of a circuit. <br/><br/>
                  The only things that change current is when the wire splits since electrons can go either way. The only way that voltage changes is when it passes a resistor or a load. Resistence is only non-zero (assuming the wire has zero resistence), is 
                  in a resistor.<br/><br/>
                  If you are give the current in the source, then that is the amount in a series will be the same, if it splits then both amounts should add up to the original. <br/><br/>
                  If you are give the voltage in the source, then no matter which path you take the voltage from the resistors and load should add up to the source. <br/><br/>
                  Resistence is dependant on the resistor, but there are methods shown previously to still figure out missing resistence. <br/><br/><br/>
                  To relate all these is the formula <b>V = IR</b>, this way if you have two of the missing variables, you can solve for the other. Remember to convert the units (instead of V and mA, convert mA to A).
