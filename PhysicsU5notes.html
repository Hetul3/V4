                  Frequency is represented as the number of cycles/total time, while period is described as total time/number of cycles. <br/><br/>
                  Frequency and periods are inverses of each other, so f=1/T and T = 1/f<br/><br/>
                  Here are the parts of a wave:<br/>

                  Transverse waves can only go through solid interfaces, while longitudinal waves can be for anything, solid, liquid, gas, plasma, etc. Sound is a longitudinal wave. <br/><br/>
                  The speed of sound in air is dependant on the temperature of the air, we can find the speed of sound with this equation:<br/><br/>
                  V = 332 + 0.6T<br/><br/>
                  Where V = velocity of sound (m/s), T = temperature in Celcius. We also use Mach as a unit when talking about sound, Mach 1 is the speed of sound, Mach 2 is twice the speed of sound, and so on. Mach 
                  changes with the speed of sound that is being refrenced.

                      The points where there is no motion is called a <b>node</b>, the points where there is maximum motion or the opposite of a node is called an 
                      <b>antinode</b>.<br/><br/>
                      The difference between a wave and pulse is that a wave is a disturbance travelling through a medium, while a pulse is a singular bump.

                  <p>
                      Most objects have a natural frequency at which they vibrate, called the object's resonance frequency. Simple geometric objects have 
                      clear resonance. If you hit an object at its frequency it will vibrate more and more. Examples of this is striking a metal rod with rosin, 
                      pushing a swing, hitting a gong, blowing over a bottle. <br/><br/>
                      Superpositioning is the idea that when you have two waves, they don't interfere or change, they just pass through each other. However, when they are in contact, they will 
                      add their amplitudes, so two positive waves will add together to be higher. But when they move past each other, they are unchanged. <br/><br/>
                      When you have both positive or both negative waves, they add constructively, when you have one positive and one negative amplitudinal wave, they destructively interfere. 
                      When a wave hits the end of the medium, it will reflect with negative amplitude of the original.

                  <h1 id="Doppler Effect">Doppler Effect</h1>
                <p>
                    Before talking about the doppler effect, we need to talk about the attributes of a wave and what they mean for sound.<br/><br/>
                    1. Higher frequencies = higher pitch<br/>
                    2. Higher amplitude = volume<br/>
                    3. Shape of wave = timbre<br/><br/>
                    The doppler effect tells us that when an object moves towards us, it will have a higher pitch and when moving away it will have a lower pitch (with the assumption the object is emitting sound). <br/><br/>
                    This is because the speed of sound is pretty slow relatively speaking. When an object emits frequencies of sound and it is coming towards us, the length between those frequencies will be less since 
                    when it emits the frequency again it is closer towards us. This gives the illusion of a higher frequency and higher pitch to us. The opposite goes for when the object is moving away. <br/><br/>
                    The way to calculate the doppler effect and the pitch you'll hear is through this equation:<br/>
                    f2 = f1(v/v-+vo)<br/>
                    Where f2 is the modified frequency we hear, f1 is the original frequency emitted, v is the speed of sound, and vo is the speed of the object. subtract vo when the object is moving towards, and add when it's moving away.

                    Blowing over a bottle makes it louder. Here is an explanation of harmonics.<br/><br/>

                    All musical intruments have:<br/>
                    1. a source of vibration<br/>
                    2. A way to select a frequency<br/>
                    3. A way to amplify that frequency<br/><br/>
                    For stringed instruments:<br/>
                    1. Source of vibration is plucking or bow<br/>
                    2. The note is selecting by meeting the criteria of node at each end.<br/>
                    3. Amplified by the sound box<br/><br/>
                    For Wind Instruments:<br/>
                    1. Lips/buzzing/reeds and air stream<br/>
                    2. Note is selected by resonnance in air column<br/>
                    3. The resonance amplifies it, and many have a flared end<br/><br/>
                    For Percution Instruments:<br/>
                    1. Striking it<br/>
                    2. Often the instrument resonates at one frequency<br/>
                    3. Instruments are big enough that they don't need to be amplified
