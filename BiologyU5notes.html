              <p>
                  The respiratory system has the major function of performing gas exchange so that 
                  your body can recieve the oxygen it needs and remove CO2 it doesn't. It also has the minor function 
                  of defending your body against microogranisms in the respiratory tract, producing sound, 
                  and assisting in the control of body fluid pH.<br/><br/>
                  The respiratory system is divided into two sections, the upper tract and lower tract.<br/><br/>
                  Upper Tract:<br/>
                  </p>

                  <p>
                  Nose/Nasal Cavity:<br/>

                   - Hairs filter dust and particles<br/>

                   - Tissues line the nasal cavity to moisten and warm the air<br/>

                   - Capillaries in the nose that when ruptured can cause nose bleed<br/>

                   - Preferred for inhalation<br/><br/>

                  Pharynx:<br/>

                   - Combines mouth and nose<br/>
                   - Splits into the trachea for air (Nasopharynx) and the esophagus (Oropharynx)<br/><br/>

                  Larynx:<br/>

                   - Voice box<br/>

                   - Epiglottis covers it<br/>

                   - Prevents food from liquids from entering into lungs<br/>

                   - Where the vocal cords are<br/><br/><br/>
                   Lower Tract:<br/>

                   Trachea:<br/>

                    - Long pipe that leads to the lungs<br/>

                    - Windpipe<br/>

                    - Cartilage covers the trachea<br/>

                   Bronchi:<br/>

                   - Divides trachea into two into each lung<br/><br/>

                   Bronchioles:<br/>

                   - Splits of bronchi that keeps splitting until it becomes ends where it contains alveoli<br/><br/>

                   Alveoli:<br/>

                    - There are 300 million alveoli<br/>

                    - The point of them is to increase surface area for gas exchange <br/>

                    - They are covered in capillaries that can allow for oxygen to transfer into the blood and CO2 from the lungs to go into the alveoli<br/>

                    - The air needs to be moist for the diffusion to occur<br/><br/>

                    Lungs:<br/>
                    - One of the largest organs of the body<br/>
                    - Has ribs to cover it and protect it, the ribs are connected by the intercostal muscles which expand and contract<br/>
                    - There is the diaphragm underneat which is basically pure muscle, 
                    it contracts and allows air to be drawn into the lungs, when 
                    relaxed it forces air out of the lungs<br/>
                    - The membrane that surronds the lungs is known as the pleural membrane
              </p>
              <h1 id="Gas Exchange and Respiration">Gas Exchange and Respiration</h1> 
              <p>
                We should all be familiar to the concept of respiration, I mean, it's the process that the whole organ system 
                is named after. Basically, it's the physical process of moving air in and out of the lungs and the body. This is 
                done through the use of the lungs, but mainly it is done with the muscles surrounding the lungs; those being the 
                diaphragm, intercostal muscles, and the thing that controls it all, the medulla oblongata.<br/><br/>

                To get a better understanding of each, we need to know the fact that the lungs cannot contract and expand on their own. 
                Remember, they're an organ without any muscle tissue so the brain cannot control the contraction and expansion of it, instead 
                when the lung actually expands, it's because of the air pressure from the air filling it. <br/><br/>
                This is due to the said muscles. When the diaphragm <b>contracts</b>, the lungs will have extra space at the bottom where they can 
                go in and fill up. Ontop of this, the intercostal muscles between your ribs will also relax and expand the rib cage to allow the lungs 
                to grow, this is the process of exhalation. 
                <br/><br/>
                The complete opposite happens when you inhale. The diaphragm and intercostal muscles will contract and the lungs will push the air 
                out since there isn't room for them to go. <br/><br/>
                Now, all of this is controlled by the part of the brain known as the medulla oblongata. It is responsible for the unconcious breathing 
                where you breathe without thinking about it (you are now probably are thinking of manually breathing and that is controlled by the frontal cortex). 
                <br/><br/>
                </p>

                When talking about gas exchange and what the process is. It represents the oxygen molecules and CO2 molecules physically being 
                transferred between the atmosphere and the red bood cells in the blood.<br/><br/>
                Like many important processes, this all happens in the lungs, or specifically the alveolis which are surrounded by by capillaries. 
                The walls between the alveoli and the capillaries are thin enough that gases and molecules can directly diffuse between them. The way that 
                they diffuse is through the phenemenom known as partial pressures. <br/><br/>
                What are partial pressures you ask? It works exactly like gas laws but is specific to the type of molecules that are being transferred. Gas will 
                tend to move from an area of high pressure to an area of low pressure to make it so that the whole region is equally balanced in these pressures. 
                Partial pressure uses the same principle, but is specific to the type of gas. So, you may have two regions, one is pressured and the other isn't, but the 
                area that is pressured may only have a little amount of gas x, while the area that is low pressured has a higher concentration of gas x. After letting both of them interact. 
                The low pressured area will have gas rush into it, but gas x will actually flow out of it to make the concentration of it even. So it doesn't matter about if the 
                blood is more or less pressured than the atmosphere, all that matters is concentration of the important molecules. In this case, oxygen is 13.3kPa concentrated in the 
                atmosphere, while the concentration of oxygen in deoxygenated blood is 5.33kPa, so the oxygen will rush in to supply that region. The opposite is true 
                for carbon dioxide as there is a higher concentration in the blood than the atmosphere so it rushes out. <br/><br/>
                This is the same process that helps oxygen diffuse into your muscles and carbon dioxide to diffuse into your blood when the blood is near the muscles.

              <p>
                While we humans use lungs to breath, many other animals have no need of that. The main example is of course gills in fish, and lungs were evolved to help 
                animals exist in the terrestrial environment outside of the water where oxygen is more abundant. However, even then it's not the case that every animal in land has 
                lungs as you'll soon see.
                <br/><br/><br/>
                Gills:<br/>
                Gills employ countercurrent flow to the water to grab as much oxygen from the water as they can. They still use the idea of gas exchange and partial pressures, but are a bit 
                more clever about it. As water goes from the front of the fish to the back, the gills will diffuse more oxygen and lowering the oxygen concentration of water making it harder 
                for the oxygen to diffuse through. In this case, blood will move counter to the current of the water, so that they can always have a favourable graident 
                with the water and always be extracting oxygen from it.

                Amphibians:<br/>
                Amphibian and specifically frog skin in some species is actually thin enough that diffuse can occur directly. So their whole skin and body acts like their lungs where the blood 
                just needs to go to the surface of the skin to get oxygen, this is one of the reasons why frogs don't require 4 chambers and only have 3 since they 
                don't need to pump deoxygentated blood to the lungs.

                Insects:<br/>
                The respiratory system of insects is different due to the fact that they have an ope circulatory system in contrast to our own closed system. In our system, blood is always 
                in blood vessels, while in an open system, the blood can be directly laid onto muscles without a layer of blood vessels, this means that their diffusion is much more direct and 
                the blood can soak in the muscles.
