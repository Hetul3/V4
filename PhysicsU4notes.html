                  Magnets, how do they work? Well the answer is both simple and complicated. For up to grade 11 we'll go through the 
                  simplier explanation. <br/><br/>
                  Magnets have two poles, a north (N) and a south (S), if you split a magnet, it'll just turn into two magnets still with a 
                  north and south pole. These types of magnets are called <b>dipole magnets</b>.<br/><br/>
                  The Earth itself is a large magnet with a north and south pole.<br/>
                  </p>

                  <center><img src="images/69.png" class="img"></center>

                  <p>
                  The <b>Domain Theory</b> states that the spin of electrons causes the magnetic field, imagine spin like a loop of electricity around 
                  an electron. Unpaired electrons on an atom will cause a field, paired electrns will cancel out so noble gases have no field. 
                  In a ferromagnet, there are many unpaired electrons and their domains are randomly pointed, the more these fields start orientated in one direction, the 
                  stronger the magnetic field. A perfect magnet will have all its domains oriented at the same direction. <br/>
                  </p>
                  <center><img src="images/71.png" class="img"></center>

                  <p>
                  We use the concept of force fields to describe forces that act over a distance. It acts from the magnet and gets weaker with distance. <br/><br/>
                  When the domains are aligned and the field is in one direction, we display the fields as <b>magnetic field lines</b>. 
                  In a magnet, the magnetic field lines will connect the north and south end with curved lines, we draw arrows to show that the lines come out of the 
                  north end and go at the south end. <br/>
                  </p>
                  <center><img src="images/70.png" class="img"></center>
                  <p>
                  These are the rules for drawing MF lines. <br/>
                  1. MF lines form complete loops<br/>
                  2. Lines come out of N pole and go into the S pole<br/>
                  3. Field lines never cross<br/>
                  4. The closer the field lines, the stronger the field<br/><br/>
                  This all explains how like magnets repel and opposite ones attract. <br/><br/>


                  A compass will point along magnetic field lines.

                  <p>
                      A DC current in a wire will make a compass needle move, therefore electricity produces a magnetic field. This field gets 
                      weaker away from the wire.<br/><br/><br/>
                      For this we use <b>Right Hand Rule #1</b>. This will tell use the direction of magnetic field from the wire. <br/>
                      </p>
                      <center><img src="images/73.png" class="img"></center>
                      <p>

                      1. Grab the wire with your right hand<br/>
                      2. The thumb will point in the direction of the current<br/>
                      3. The fingers will curl in the direction of the magnetic field<br/><br/>
                      Magnetic fields have the unit of Tesla (T), 1T is considered very strong, the strongest magnets we can make are 30-100T. <br/><br/><br/>
                      When we coil a wire, the magnetic field gets stronger, in this case, the direciton of the coiling does matter. Using the ideas of the 
                      fact that electricity emits a magnetic field and RH#1, we can make another right hand rule. <b>Right Hand Rule #2</b>.<br/><br/>
                      RH#2 helps you figure out the poles of the coiled wire, which now creates a temporary magnet called an <b>electromagnet</b>. The electromagnet will be 
                      stronger if you have an iron core. <br/>
                      </p>
                      <center><img src="images/74.png" class="img"></center>
                      <center><img src="images/75.png" class="img"></center>
                      <p>
                      1. Grab the coil with your right hand<br/>
                      2. Fingers will curl in the direction of the current<br/>
                      3. The thumb will point to the North end of the electromagnet<br/><br/>
                      To make the field stronger, you need more coils, more current, and use an iron core, that's it! Having heavier cores doesn't make it stronger, the number of coils matter, 
                      having a larger coil diameter will reduce friction but not make it stronger. <br/><br/><br/>
                      Finally, there is electromotive force or the <b>Lorentz Force</b>. Consider a wire in a magnetic field. The wire will be repelled if electricity is passed through the wire. 
                      This is because of RH#1; on one end, the magnetic field lines will add up in the same direction so it will be repelled, and on the other end the lines will cancel and there will be no force. 
                      Therefore, the wire will be repelled in one direction. <br/>
                      </p>
                      <center><img src="images/76.png" class="img"></center>
                      <p>
                      1. Have a flat hand, the thumb will be perpendicular to your fingers<br/>
                      2. The fingers will point in the direciton of the magnetic field<br/>
                      3. The thumb will point in the direction of the current<br/>
                      4. Then your palm will face the direction of the lorentz force<br/>

                      DC motors use the idea of an electromagnet and alternating current to make a axel spin very fast. If you would like to see

                      Magnetic induction is a method to generate electricity. When electricity goes through a coil, it makes a magnetic field. Micheal Faraday 
                      stated that whenever the field around a wire (coil) changes, electrons are induced to flow in the wire. <br/><br/>
                      This means that somethng must be moving, either the magnet going in and out fo the coil or the coil in and out of the magnet. 
                      This is how we generate electricity with things like hydro-electric dams, nuclear power, oil, coal, etc. <br/><br/>
                      The way to generate more electricity is when there is a stronger magnetic field, having more coils, and having the motion be faster.

                  <p>
                      Transformers are devices that transform (change) voltage and current. If voltiage is high and current is low, then after a transformer the 
                      voltage and current is flipped.<br/>
                      </p>
                      <center><img src="images/77.png" class="img"></center>
                      <p>
                      1. The way that it works is that AC goes into the primary coil <br/>
                      2. This makes an alternating magnetic field in the cone<br/>
                      3. It goes through the core to the secondary coil<br/>
                      4. This creates electricity in the secondary coil (induction)<br/>
                      5. The output electricity will be AC<br/><br/>
                      Putting in DC current will make a stationary magnetic field so it won't alternate to make electricity. Therefore, transformer only work with AC current. <br/><br/>
                      The equation to figure out the input and output voltage is <br/><br/>
                      N1/N2 = V1/V2<br/><br/>
                      Where N is the number of primary and secondary coils, and V is the input and output voltage. <br/><br/>
                      Transformers have no moving parts, and well designed ones can operate at over 95% efficiency. If we assume 100% efficiency:<br/><br/>
                      (I1)(V1) = (I2)(V2)<br/><br/>
                      Where I is input and output current and V is input and output voltage.<br/><br/>
                      Transformers can also be used to cut off high frequencies and for wireless chargers.
