              <p>
                  The organs of the digestive system are split up into two different categories
                  the GI tract (gasthro-intestinal tract) and the accessory organs. <br/><br/>
                  </p>

                  <br/><br/>
                  <b>GI TRACT</b> <br/><br/>
                  Mouth: <br/>
                  Mouth has the purpose of mechanical and chemical digestion. Mechanically, 
                  it chews up food and breaks it down into smaller chunks with the help of <b>teeth</b>. 
                  Teeth can also be broken down into their respective types and purposes; incisors chop pieces, 
                  canines pierce tear, premolars and molars will grind the food. <br/><br/>
                  Chemically, the <b>salivary glands</b> secret saliva with the purpose of breaking down starches on a molecular scale.
                  These glands are Parotid, Sublingual, Submandibular.
                  <br/>

                  <br/>                  <br/>
                  <p>
                  Esophagus:<br/>
                  The esophagus is a large muscular tube that has the purpose of moistening the food and is the tunnel that 
                  connects the mouth to the stomach. The muscles of the esophagus are there to force down food that won't go down. 
                  As an example, you can eat food upside down as the muscles of the esophagus force food up, this is how astronuats can still 
                  eat in zero gravity. The esophagus connects to the stomach through the cardiac orifice.
                  </p>

                  <br/>                  <br/>                  <br/>
                  <p>
                  Stomach: <br/>
                  The main function of the stomach other than to break down food further is to hold food. It can hold food for 
                  4 hours and during that time it uses chemical and mechanical digestion to break down food and specifically proteins. 
                  Chemically through its secretion of Pepsinogen (from the gastric pits secreted by chief cells) and storage of HCI, when the Pepsinogen in reaction to the acid will 
                  turn into Pepsin which can break down starches. The stomach breaks down the food mechanically by churning and contracting 
                  the food, this also has the secondary effect of mixing the food with the secretions. 
                  </p>

                  <br/>                  <br/>                  <br/>
                  <p>
                  Small Intestine:<br/>
                  This is probably the most important organ in the GI Tract. Proteins, starches, sugars, and lipids are all broken down further 
                  in this organ and this is where nutrients is diffused into the blood stream.<br/><br/>
                  The 3 parts of the small intestine are th Duodenum (5% of length), Jejunum (almost 40%), Ileum (almost 60%). Most of the secretions from the 
                  small intestine and the other organs like pancrease and gall bladder are released in the Duodenum.<br/><br/>
                  The small intestine has a lot of circular folds which increase the surface area of the small intestine, and these folds have 
                  little fingers called <b>Villi</b>, these villi have even more villi called <b>Microvilli</b>. Microvilli have 
                  a blood vessels which extract the broken down nutrients, and supporting the villi is a lacteal which stores borken down lipids. 
                  The point of all these villis is to increase surface area, this is also the reason why the small intestine is so long. <br/> 
                  </p>

                  <br/>                  <br/>                  <br/>
                  <p>
                  Large Intestine:<br/>
                  The large intestine as the purpose of extracting water and convert the food into waste. There isn't any digestions or secretions in this organ, the other main function of the 
                  large intestine is to hold food for a longer period of time. <br/><br/>
                  The large intestine is broken up into the Cecum (the large intestine is connected to the Cecum through the Ileocecal valve), Ascending Colon, Transverse Colon, 
                  Descending Colon, and Sigmoid Colon. The end of the small intestine is the rectum which is a large muscle that holds waste until it is time to release it. <br/><br/>
                  The internal layer of the large intestine contains the largest amount of goblet cells which secret mucus to make the material slow smoothly (almost all the other organs of the GI Tract also has goblet cells).

                  <p>
                  Liver:<br/>
                  Liver has 500 unique functions, a few of which is to aid in digestions. Other than the skin, the liver is the largest organ. The liver has the function of 
                  secreting bile which helps break down lipids. The liver picks up glucose from the blood and lowers blood sugar. Stores said glucose as glycogen. Stores vitamins, detoxifies poisons and drugs, and makes blood proteins. <br/><br/><br/>
                  Gallblasser:<br/>
                  The purpose of the gallbladder is to store the bile produced by the liver for later use, it will secrete the bile to the duodenum when needed.<br/><br/><br/>
                  Pancreas:<br/>
                  Pancreas produces some of the other secretions and hormones like insulin which lowers blood sugar and glucagon which increases blood sugar.
